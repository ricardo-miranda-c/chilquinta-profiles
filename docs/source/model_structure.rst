Model Structure
===============

Components
----------
- **PV System**: Efficiency, capacity, generation profiles
- **Battery**: Capacity, round-trip efficiency, degradation
- **Grid**: Tariff structure, availability, limits

Geolocation
-----------
Each profile is linked to a location to derive:
- Solar irradiation
- Grid cost by year
