Capacity Factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The capacity factor is a measure of how much energy a power plant produces compared to its maximum potential output.
It is calculated as the ratio of the actual output of the plant to the maximum possible output over a given period of time.
The capacity factor is expressed as a percentage and is an important metric for evaluating the performance of power plants,
especially renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
The capacity factor is influenced by several factors, including the availability of the energy source 
(e.g., sunlight for solar plants or wind for wind farms), the design and efficiency of the power plant,
and the operational strategy employed. A higher capacity factor indicates that a power plant is producing
energy more consistently and efficiently, while a lower capacity factor suggests that the plant is not operating
at its full potential.

The capacity factor is calculated using the following formula:
.. math::
   CF = \frac{\sum_{y,z} e\_prod(y,x,t)}{\sum_{y,x} e\_cap(y,x) \cdot \sum_t \text{timeres}(t)}
